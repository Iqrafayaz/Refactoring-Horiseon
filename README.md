# Refactoring-Horiseon

## Description 

The aim of this project was to take the existing code and refactor it in order to increase web accessability. This was done through HTML and CSS. 

By using semantic HTML elements and alt attributes, I was able to increase Search Engine Optimization as well as create a better user experience. Semantic elements make it much easier for user devices to determine the value behind the context of the webpage and increase overall accessability. Alt attibutes offer very similar advantages as they ensure information about images are availabe for those visually impaired or unable to see pictures.

Consolidating and organising CSS selectors and properties implemented the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) Code and as such left the much more effecient than previously presented. By using comments througout the Stylesheet, it ensured that the code will be easier read and understood if/when it is looked at later on. This is an essential as is is highly likely that other designers and developers will read the code, and comments can aid them in understanding the refactored code.

Though JavaScript has not been used in this project, it remains an ambition for future projects as I am very interested in developing interative web pages. During this journey, I learned and consolidated my knowledge on the importance of class and id attributes as well as the overall benefits of a structured code. Though I struggled on editing the CSS framework, I learnt alot about CSS selectors and will continue learning more about them for future projects.

## Usage 
 
 On the webpage, on the right corner, opposite the title, are three headings, which are linked to blocks of texts and images lower down on the page. As shown in the first two images.

The coding behind each of these links is displayed in the images of the Index.html file below.

This first image displays a hash within a hyperlink that signifies a HTML element id to which the window should be scrolled. In this case it refers the window to the image below.

This image uses class and id attributes act as selectors that help make the code easier to write and consolidate. The alt displayed in this image are a essential feature in creating a more accessible webpage, as they will help users understand what each image represents, even if the image is unavailable to them.

It is important to mention that I added spacing through this entire HTML document that wasnt in the original; this was so the code would be easier to read and understand in all its sections. It is much harder to find problems or errors within a code when it is very crowded.

Another example is this image:

Where the index.html document built the framework of the webpage, the CSS style sheet designed it.

This image not only displays essential style feature such as the CSS box model (in code), and sets colours, but also important comments that developers or designers may look at later to clarify specific areas of code. This is also done in the image below.

This image displays the importance of the DRY code and demonstrates the importance of efficent coding.
